## Our Idea
Our Idea is simple, we wanted to solve the problem of not getting ambulance on time in Nagpur.
So we came up with the idea of creating a geolocation based mobile app, like uber, which can fetch you
the nearest available ambulance on click of a button.

## Tech Stack
1. Java from android
2. Firebase for backend
3. Google Maps API for maps
